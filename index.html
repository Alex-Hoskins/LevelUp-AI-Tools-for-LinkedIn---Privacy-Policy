  <h1>Privacy Policy for LevelUp: AI Tools for LinkedIn</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 19, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    LevelUp: AI Tools for LinkedIn ("the Extension", "we", "us", or "our") is a browser extension
    designed to help users create, improve, and manage LinkedIn content and messages using AI-powered tools.
    We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how your information is handled.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect, transmit, or store any personal data or LinkedIn data on our servers.
    All data processed by the extension remains on your device.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OpenAI API Key:</strong> Your API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage (or Chrome extension storage) and is never sent to any external server other than OpenAI's API, as required for generating content.</li>
    <li><strong>Message History & Preferences:</strong> Any message history, settings, or preferences are stored locally in your browser and are not transmitted to us or any third party.</li>
    <li><strong>LinkedIn Data:</strong> The extension only accesses LinkedIn profile information (name and position) when you explicitly use the auto-generate feature. This data is used solely to populate message templates and is not stored or transmitted to any external servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Use of Permissions</h2>
  <p>The extension requests only the minimum permissions necessary for its features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Required to extract profile information from LinkedIn pages and enable the auto-generate feature for message templates.</li>
    <li><strong>tabs:</strong> Required to detect when you're on a LinkedIn profile page and automatically populate message fields with the person's name and position.</li>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your settings, API key, and message history locally.</li>
    <li><strong>contextMenus:</strong> To provide right-click menu options for generating replies (optional permission).</li>
    <li><strong>sidePanel:</strong> To display the extension's interface in a side panel.</li>
    <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> To interact with the currently active tab for context menu actions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>OpenAI:</strong> When you use the AI features, your content and API key are sent directly from your device
    to OpenAI's API for processing. Please review <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>We do not have access to your data at any time.</li>
    <li>All LinkedIn data accessed by the extension is used only for the immediate purpose of generating messages and is not stored or transmitted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the extension or on the extension's listing page.
